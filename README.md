This project has no real purpose, it exists only to make me laugh.

The project contains a register route which shows a form input consisting of username and password. If the user tries to register with the password that is already in use, they will get an error message, otherwise the succes message is being shown and user is registered.


The project follows SOLID principles as much as possible, it has a repository pattern and feature tests. It is however a very small project.
